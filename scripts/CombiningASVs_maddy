# Program to combine multiple ASVs table into one large table, and output
# the table and a fasta file of the unique sequences

# This package is used to conveniently bind together the tables
# and automatically fill in empty cells with zeroes instead of NA
require(gtools)

# Create variable that reads in each ASV table. Can do more by reading
# in more tables and including them in the smartbind step
a = readRDS("Path/to/Table1")
b = readRDS("Path/to/Table2")

# Bind together tables, giving the option for how to fill empty cells
WholeTable = smartbind(a, b, fill = 0)

# Note that your table will be missing its row names/sample IDs. Here are the steps
# to reapply row names:

anames = rownames(a)
bnames = rownames(b)
nameslist = c(anames, bnames)
rownames(WholeTable) = nameslist

# It is worth verifying that the rows added in the correct order, but this should be correct

#If you need a fasta file that contains one copy each of the sequences:

# Package used to write out a fasta file
require(seqinr)

# Create a vector that contains the column names of the ASV table (AKA the sequences)
z = vector()
z = append(z, colnames(WholeTable))

# Check that you have all your sequences
length(z)

# Create a vector that will hold identifiers for the sequences that follow the pattern:
# ASV1, ASV2, ASV3, etc.
y = vector()
for(i in length 1:length(z)){
	y[[i]] = paste("ASV", i, sep = "")
}

names(z) = y
write. fasta(sequences = as.list(z), names = as.list(names(z)), file.out = "Name of Fasta File", open = "w")
